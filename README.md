## Start developing

Copy the template `.env.template` file to `.env.development` and `.env.production`.

```shell
cp .env.template .env.development
cp .env.template .env.production
```

`.env.production` will need new values for every variable.

Then install dependencies and start the server.

```shell
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Cache Site Bundles

In the root of the directory, there is a `/data` folder. This is where the cached data from `egghead-rails` api will live.

The first think you need to do is fill out `/data/content.config.js`. This file indicates what bundles this site is selling. There is currently 2 expected bundles: a pro tier and a book tier. This can be adjusted to the specific site needs.

You can add `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRO_SLUG` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BOOK_SLUG` to your `.env.development` and `.env.production` if these are the two tiers you are selling with the site.

To load development data from the rails api, make sure you rails db is set up and run `yarn build:data:dev`. You will need to create a local `BUNDLE_BUDDY_TOKEN` (See below for details).

### Setup bundle buddy bot

Get your `BUNDLE_BUDDY_TOKEN` in your `env.development`. This can be generated by logging into your rails console with `rails c` and:

```
user = User.find_by_email('bundle.buddy+bot@egghead.io')
user.access_tokens.create
```

Make sure bundle buddy has the `:bundler` role.

```ruby
user = User.find_by_email('bundle.buddy+bot@egghead.io')
user.roles.map(&:name)
# => ["user", "bundler"]
# if bundler isnt in that array:
user.add_role :bundler
```

### Logging In

To log in, you need to have a purchase associated with the log in email.

Once you have a purchase, head over to the `/login` page and enter your email. If you are running local development, the log in link will be printed to the console of the `egghead-rails` server.

If you are in production, you should receive an email with a log in link.

### Rails database

`rake staging:update_local_dev_database` in your `egghead-rails` directory to get the latest DB.

The DB updater needs github creds that go in `~/.netrc`:

```
machine api.github.com
  login USERNAME
  password SECRET
```

#### Set Up Oauth

An oauth application will need to be created in the egghead database. It's better to create an Oauth Application ([here's the link](https://app.egghead.io/oauth/applications/new)) on production and copy the values to local dev so you dont get conflicting variables later on.

If one doesn't exist for the site already, then we will have to create one in the production and development database.

In the rails console:

```ruby
application = Doorkeeper::Application.create(
  name: "My Product",
  redirect_uri: "https://my-product.com/redirect",
  confidential: false,
  internal_application: true,
  site_url: "https://my-product.com",
  statement_descriptor: "My Product"
  )

site_tenant = SiteTenant.create(name: 'my_product', application: application)

application.uid # this value should be placed in NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID
site_tenant.name # this value should be placed in NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME
```

When creating the oauth application in production you will want to set the image for the application.

## Require login on a route

There are a couple of things you need to do to require login for a page.

The first thing is import up `useRequireLogin`.

```ts
import useLoginRequired from 'hooks/use-login-required'
```

This hook will return a `boolean` value. This value lets you know if the hook is still verifying that the user has access to the page. So if the hook is still verifying, we need to `return null` from our component to avoid a potential flash of content before the redirect.

```tsx
const SomeComponent = () => {
  const isVerifying = useLoginRequired()

  if (isVerifying) {
    return null
  }
  return <></>
}
```
